<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Z29PI1m.png">

This script replicates the original Source Physics bug that allows players to bhop and strafe to dramatically increase their speeds. Built using the Unity Engine and C#.

## Backstory

When the Source Engine for Valve's games first released, players discovered a bug in it's physics where you are able to gain a ridiculious amount of speed when peforming certain precise movements concurrently ('strafing' paired with 'bhopping'). The skill needed to take advantage of this bug was extremely high, therefore Valve (The creators of the Source Engine) decided to not fix it so skilled players can take advantage of the mechanic when they wish to.
